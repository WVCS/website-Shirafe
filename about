    <h2> About Me! </h2>
      <p> My name is Shira Ehrlich and I go to Westview High School. </p>
        <p> My teacher's name is Ms. Neumann and I am in her period 4 Computer Science Principles class. 
          </p>
       <p> 
         I took Computer Science Principles because I wanted to have some experience with coding and be more knowledgable about computers. 
  </p>
    <p>
      My favorite project that we did this year was the lists project because I felt like I was pretty advanced into coding and because I could see my growth from our first project. </p>
